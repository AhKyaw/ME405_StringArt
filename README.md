  <h1>String Art Machine</h1>
  <p><strong>By:</strong> Ahkar Kyaw, Elvis Tang</p>
</div>

In tutorial we will learn how to build a machine that can replicate an image using strings. We built this machine for our ME405 class. It is still a work in progress with many rooms for improvement but we are very pleased with how far it has come and we are excited to share the project with you. 

# Introduction
String art, often referred to as pin-and-thread art, refers to a form of art that weaves colored string, wool, wire, or yarn between hammered nails to make geometric patterns. String art is not new and its origins go all the way back to the 19th century. It started off as an educational tool to introduce mathematical ideas to children but came back in the late 1960s as a decorative craft in a form of books and kits. 

Inspired by the beauty and complexity of this art style, we decided to build a machine that can replicate any image using lines and recreate it physically in a form of string art. This was a very challenging project and due to time constraint, we were unable to perfect it to our desired standard. However, it works and we are thrilled to share our project with you. Hopefully you will find ways to improve our project further.

# System Design
## System Operating Procedure
<p>The figure below shows how the string art machine works. First, we need to convert the image to string art and generate its pin sequence via the Python file StringArt_Gen.py on our computer. After the pin sequence is generated, we will transfer this data to the Nucleo STM32 board. And based on the finite state machine and pin sequence, the Nucleo board will communicate with the motor driver through the SPI protocol and further control the motor to perform desired actions.</p>

</div>


## Mechanical Design
To begin with, letâ€™s take a look at the mechanical components of this machine. The overall frame this machine is made entirely out of 80/20 aluminum extrusion. The machines moves using 3 stepper motors and a DC motor with a drill attached to the tip. These motors are then mounted onto the frame using custom 3D printed parts. CAD files for these 3D printed parts can be found under Manufacturing - 3D Printer Source files. 

For the drawing board, we used a laser cut MDF board. The DXF file for laser cutting can be found under Manufacturing - Laser Cutter Source files. Once the board is cut, attach it onto the 3D printed braket #4 and the lazy susan, which will be attached to the machine's frame. You can either directly use this board as your art canvas or mount another MDF board onto this existing platform using the pre-cut alignmnet holes. 

The full CAD model to assist you with the assembly of the whole machine can be found in the CAD folder under our GitHub, ME405_StringArt Repository.

## Software Design
### String Art Generator
Our current StringArt_Gen.py file is heavily based on this github repository: [kaspermeerts/stringart.py](https://gist.github.com/kaspermeerts/781f0137b361b51224dcab722ae387b4), and also the knowledge in this paper: [String Art: Towards Computational Fabrication of String Images](https://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/geom/ig/publications/stringart/stringart.pdf).
<p>The two figures below show the image before and after string art conversion. And before we input the image into the string art generator, we need to crop the image into square shape to make the program run normally.</p>

# Challenges
### Inconsistent Nail Height:<br>

| ![](media/5.jpg) | The first problem we encountered was the height inconsistency among the nails that we purchased. Even though we managed to drill all the holes to be exactly the same depth, the point of contact between each nail and the looping needle is different. Therefore, the string occasionally slip over the top if the nail is too short compared to others. To fix this problem, you need an alternative string feeding mechanism where the string is fed directly from the top instead of the side like what we have. This way, you the needle can loop the strings along a much lower plane without having to worry about the string getting tangled up. |
| ----------------- |:----------------|


### String Getting Tangled Up:<br>
| ![](media/6.jpg) | The Second problem we encountered was with regards to the string getting tangled up after looping around the nail. There are two main reasons for why this happen. First is due to the lack of tension in the string. This lack of retraction causes the string to droop down after the needle pulls the string to loop around the nail everytime. When the board rotates after the looping step, the loose string causes the strings to get tangled up. The second reason is due to the nails not being slanted enough. We knew that if all the strings remain at the same height after each loop, it will cause them to crash with each other causing the stings to get tangled up when rotating the board. Therefore, we tiltted the drilling at 5 degree angle from the vertical hoping that the slope will cause the strings to slide down after each loop. However, the slpe was not steep enough, causing the strings to get tangled up. To fix this problem, you could modify the string feeding system so that it goes through several pulley to maintain the tension in the string. You could also add a retraction system to the spool of string so that it will prevent the string from drooping down after pulling it too far. |
